# Auto Cookie Clicker (For Testing and Training Purposes Only)

This is a Python project that automates the process of clicking on cookies in the game [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). The program utilizes the Selenium library to interact with the browser and simulate clicks in the game. **This project is intended solely for testing and training purposes in automation.**.

- `pynput`: For capturing keyboard and mouse events.
- `tkinter`: For creating the graphical interface.
- `selenium`: For automating browser interaction.
- `pillow(PIL)`: For working with images.

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pynput tkinter selenium pillow
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/auto-cookie-clicker.git
